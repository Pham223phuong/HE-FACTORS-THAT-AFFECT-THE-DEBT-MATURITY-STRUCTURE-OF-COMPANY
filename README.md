The choice of a suitable debt maturity structure is exceptionally relevant for firms because it can enable them to avoid mismatch by aligning assets in line with liabilities, addressing agency-related problems, sidestepping the ill effects of the cost of capital, and signaling the firmsâ€™ earning quality and value.
